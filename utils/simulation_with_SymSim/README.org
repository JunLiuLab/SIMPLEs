* Simulation

** tool: SymSim
** generate data:
*** need to consider:
    - experiment platform:
      - UMI (SIMPLEs is not designed for this type actually)
      - reads
    - compare on:
      - differential expression gene
      - clustering
    - data request:
      - model cell clusters
      - model differential expression genes
    - suggests
      - use the optimized or default parameters from simulation tools
