* Time complexity 

** Data sources
We use the dataset as the same as in the mouse immune cells experiment (See
expriments/reproduce_TM_anlaysis/data_preprocessing.R for details). 
- dataset_for_timer.R
We partition the cells into several groups.

** How to run
*** Jobs under make
- Our jobs are organized and executed by *make* under the *jobs* directory.
- Our jobs are submitted into the *slurm* to run. But you can get it run locally
  by following the shell scripts under *jobs*. 
*** SIMPLEs
- simple_timer.R is used to get the time cost for SIMPLEs.
- others_timer.R is used to get the time cost for other methods.

** Result Summary
- simple_timer_summary.R is used to generate Supplementary Text: Figure S14.
- timer_compare_summary.R is used to generate Supplementary Text: Figure S19.
