* Simulation with SymSim
** Required  packages
- prepare_packages.R is used to install the packages needed, which could be used
  as a reference. 

** How to Run
- Our jobs are organized and executed by *make* under the *jobs* directory.
- Our jobs are submitted into the *slurm* to run. But you can get it run locally
  by following the shell scripts under *jobs*. 
*** Data generation
- setup_simdata.R is used to generate the simulation data by SymSim for this
  experiments.
*** Run scVI
- In *scVI*, the files are used to describe how to convert generated data for
  scVI, and how to run scVI. Again, we use *make* under the $jobs$ sub-directory
  under *scVI*.
*** Run SIMPLEs and other methods.
- eval_simulation_singlejob.R describe how to run different imputation methods.

** Result Summary
- result_summary.R is used to generate Supplementary Text: Figure S15-16.
